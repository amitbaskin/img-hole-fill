In this project I used openjdk 16.0.1 2021-04-20 and javac 16.0.1

Usage:
Inside the directory that contains the package: 
compile all by javac img_hole_fill\*.java.

Run the following command depending on the operating system your working on:
Mac: java img_file_name\Main <ImgFileName> <MaskFileName> <8 or 4 connectivity>
Windows: java img_file_name\Main.java <ImgFileName> <MaskFileName> <8 or 4 connectivity>
Linux: java img_file_name.Main <ImgFileName> <MaskFileName> <8 or 4 connectivity>

The default is 4-connectivity, however you may provide a third argument requesting 8-connectivity.
A third argument will count as 8-connectivity regardless of its content.

Both images must be in the current working directory and of the following formats: GIF, PNG, JPEG, BMP or WBMP.

The two images should be of the same dimensions, otherwise an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException may occur.

For further results, uncomment the commented lines in the main method.

Note: there is a JavaDocs directory from which you can easily view the API of the library.
